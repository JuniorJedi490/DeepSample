# DeepSample
Audio Processing Project

Week of Jan 25 2020

Hue and I developed the main idea of DeepSample, and began searching for research papers
to base our work on.  

Week of Feb 1 2020

Hue created the first draft of our abstract, and I found a paper to base our work on.
I proceeded to email the authors and try to obtain their source.  

Week of Feb 8 2020

Hue finished creating the beginnings of the user interface for DeepSample, I failed to 
receive a response from the author of the research paper, so we decided to proceed 
without the original source.  Hue recommended looking at cepstrum signal analysis, and I 
found several papers using this algorithm and algorithms related to it.  We are planning to 
use these as the basis of our research.

Week of Feb 15 2020
Created a working implementation of the zero-crossing algorithm.  Added a file describing the algorithms we are targeting, and began a works cited list for use in the final paper.
